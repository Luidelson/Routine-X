# Routine-X 🏋️‍♂️

Routine-X is a full-stack gym calendar and client management app designed to make fitness planning, progress tracking, and client communication seamless for trainers, admins, and gym members. Born from the need to organize workouts, manage memberships, and foster a fitness community, Routine-X brings together scheduling, nutrition, and social features in one modern platform.

This project challenged me to build a robust, user-friendly system that supports real-world gym workflows, persistent data, and interactive features for both trainers and clients.
